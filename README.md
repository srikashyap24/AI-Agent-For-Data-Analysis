## Setup Instructions

### 1. Prepare Your Project Structure
Upload the following folders into your project:
- `templates/` (HTML templates for UI)
- `static/` (CSS and static assets)
- `uploads/` (for storing uploaded CSV files)

### 2. Add Your Python Files
Make sure you have your main Flask app (`app.py`) and MCP server (`mcp_server.py`) in the root or `app/` folder.

### 3. Create a Python Virtual Environment
```sh
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### 4. Install Dependencies
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 5. Add Your OpenAI API Key
Create a file named `.env` in the same folder as your Python files:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```
**Never commit your `.env` file to git!**

### 6. Run the MCP Server
```sh
python mcp_server.py
```

### 7. Run the Flask App
Open a new terminal, activate your environment, and run:
```sh
python app.py
```

### 8. Access the App
Go to [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) in your browser.

## Troubleshooting
- **OpenAI API errors:** Check your `.env` and API key.
- **MCP server not running:** Make sure `mcp_server.py` is started before `app.py`.
- **CSV upload issues:** Ensure your file is a valid CSV and not too large.
